### Pre-requisites

The following should be installed for the demos to work:

* [emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) for the `asm.js` and WebAssembly demos
* [http-service (node.js)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) to serve the "primes" example site (any simple web server will do)
* [Blazor](https://jlik.me/fhs) has full instructions for installing and using Blazor.


### Get Started

Create a new Blazor project with .NET Core hosting. Run the application and step through the tabs.
1. dotnet new blazorwasm -o BlazingTrails/BlazingTrails.Client
2. dotnet new sln -n BlazingTrails
3. dotnet sln add BlazingTrails\BlazingTrails.Client

### Debugging

1. Open URL in Chrome for any of the apps
2. Show `SHIFT+ALT+D` key press
3. If instructions appear, close all Chrome instances (including in the system tray) and paste the code to run with debugging enabled
4. Repeat the key press
5. Show a breakpoint and discuss this is very limited for now
